# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies only compatible with the
#   platform that pipenv install预先 was executed on. If the pipenv install command is run on a
#   different platform, a "Pipfile.lock not found" error will be thrown. Moreover, it is recommended
#   to include "Pipfile" but not "Pipfile.lock", in case of collaboration.
#   See https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/739.
#Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
